# AI-Based Soil Analysis and Recommendation System

This is a **group project** developed using **Python, Flask, and Machine Learning**, integrated with **Google Gemini AI** to analyze soil data and provide intelligent recommendations related to soil health and crop suitability.

The application processes soil data from a CSV dataset and predicts key soil parameters such as moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient levels.  
Based on these predictions, the system uses Gemini AI to generate detailed soil analysis and improvement suggestions through a web-based interface.

This project demonstrates the practical application of **machine learning, data analysis, AI integration, and web development** in an agricultural domain.
